# Lunux Learning

I learn lunux by a book called, "Understanding UNIX/LINUX Programming: A Guide to Theory and Practice."  

By simulating build-in function such as more, who, cp, ls,

I learn some useful linux commands, how to compile linux execution files, and how to use c language to manage system data.
