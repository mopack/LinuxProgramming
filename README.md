# Lunux Learning

* I learn lunux by a book called, "Understanding UNIX/LINUX Programming: A Guide to Theory and Practice."  

* I used the ubuntu 16 operation system, and by C language.

* By simulating build-in function such as more, who, cp, ls, I learn some useful linux commands, how to compile linux execution files, and how to use C language to manage system data.
