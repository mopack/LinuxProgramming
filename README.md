# Lunux Learning

* I learn lunux by a book called, "Understanding UNIX/LINUX Programming: A Guide to Theory and Practice."  

* I used the Ubuntu operation system, and practice programming by C language.

* By simulating build-in function such as more, who, cp, ls, I learn some common and useful linux commands, how to compile linux execution files, and how to use C language to manage system data.
